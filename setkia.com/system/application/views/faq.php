<strong>
I have used up my free credits. How do I get more?
</strong>
<br />
Currently it isn't possible to buy credits from us. This is currently in test and we hope to make it available soon.
For now, please contact an admin at admin@setkia.com and we can provide you with more free credits for testing.

<strong>
How much does it cost to send a message?
</strong>
<br />
We determine pricing based on credits, to find out how many credits each SMS requires please see our <?php echo anchor('about/pricing', 'pricing info'); ?>
<br />
From our experience a provisioning message will take between 2 and 6 SMS.

<strong>
Can I send settings to more than my own phone?
</strong>
<br />
Currently you can only send to the phone number that you registered with. We plan to add a feature to allow users
to send to multiple approved phone numbers in the near future.

<strong>
You mention service provider support, however I cannot find a way to register as a service provider. How do I do this?
</strong>
<br />
The service provider section is  currently under development. We hope to have it available soon. For further information about what we plan
for service providers, email about@setkia.com.
<br />
If you have any requests for features you would like as a service provider, please contact us at admin@setkia.com

<strong>
Some settings have not been implemented. Why is this?
</strong>
<br />
Setkia is currently under active development and we hope to have more setting types implemented soon. You can still send these settings
to a user by manually creating them and using the send XML or WBXML features.

<strong>
The settings I'm looking for aren't available. How can I request them?
</strong>
<br />
If there is a settings type that you would like to see in Setkia, please email admin@setkia.com and we will review them for inclusion in setkia.
<br />
Any details about the settings that you can send us would be helpful.
